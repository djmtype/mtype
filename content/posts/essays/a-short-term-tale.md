*The only way to tell this tale of a dad with a dementia disorder is to begin with a recent, random event.*

The day unfolded as another magical morning with an echo of Monday stirring in the background. It might be relevant to emphasize, Tuesday was a blur, and today is now Wednesday. As I (should’ve) mentioned, my father is no longer allowed to leave the house without an escort. Against all wishes, this 71 year-old, stubborn man argued while fleeing through the garage, then sprinting down the street in the rain. 

Having some idea of his patterns by now, I guessed he would be walking towards the *Trader Joe’s* in town. I arrived shortly before him in wake of a busy parking lot. Upon his entry, his glistening bright white head glided across, in B-line formation, towards the end of the building. There he stood, next to a stranger’s vacant black SUV. He began scouting around, making sure the coast was clear as if he was going to attempt and open the door. To say the least, it was shocking to see him in pursuit. Perhaps, in his mind, his jacket cloaked his every move with the sight of camouflage to the sound of stealth. But, on the contrary…. Although, no sun could be seen in the sky, a spotlight pierced straight through onto this man in blue. 

While observing my father, watching him observe the crowd, I was on a call with my brother discussing our father’s worsening habits while trying to capture this whole incident by phone. Unfortunately, a different, oversized SUV pulled into the lot and totally obstructed my view. 

In midst of all the commotion, I saw a woman come out of the store. With package in hand, she looked directly at my father in awe. A split-second later she pulled out her phone and began dialing. It’s hard to know for certain whether she was the owner of the black SUV or she was calling the police regardless. And, just maybe, my imagination was getting the best of me. However, knowing my dad’s late bizarre behavior holds enough evidence to support my paranoia. In any case, I felt like I had to take action before this scenario escalated into a scene of sirens and over-caffeinated cop cars. 

Not to startle him, I casually approached my dad. He was obviously caught off guard by my presence. I asked why he was standing next to the black car. My father’s sense of right versus wrong may be fading fast, but he always has a reason. Did I mention these “reasons” usually include tall-tales? He said the car happened to be in the direction of the barbershop he was walking towards. Of course he tried to explain in his own manner, using hand gestures and broken phrases of misused words. 

To note, his barber is located in the next town over. With determination, he was animate about going to see *Carmen the Barber*[^1], yet I insisted he should get into my car before the chance passed us by. The best argument I could conjure was telling my dad the policeman from the other day was out looking for him. My father remained hesitant still, but finally gave in when I told him the officer’s car was just around the corner. Truthfully, there was a police vehicle parked next store which I used to entice my own tale. 

After I brought him home, his urge to visit the barbershop remained. So, moments later, I drove him to see Carmen as I waited outside. 

A terrible feeling of guilt came over me, especially after he thanked me twice. I was waiting around simply because his ill compulsion can’t be trusted. Instead, I should’ve been waiting to drive him home, making sure he got there safely. 

Having spare time on my hands, I began writing this message as an email to a friend who also has a *dad on dementia*. This same email evolved into a little self-reminder: 

> No matter how bad it [the disorder] gets, I’d rather be running after a mischievous man-child rather than being without a dad to chase around at all.

[^1]: Carmen was our childhood barber. As youngsters, my dad, brothers and I use go to the same barbershop.
