4. NTRP Grievances filed within 21 days of the start date of the player’s and/or captain’s State Championships will be administered after the event unless the section authorizes the administration of the grievance prior to that time. If the grievance is not administered until after the event, points won by players will stand. Disqualified players and/or captains that are suspended will not be eligible to advance to the next level of championship play. USTA South Carolina mandates that the party (ies) that file(s) the NTRP grievance complaint must provide the documentation to support their complaint at the time of their filing.
5. Players with expired ratings will not be allowed to self-rate at a lower level than their last published NTRP rating. However, they will have the opportunity to an immediate, on-line, self-rate appeal.



6. Self-ratings are valid for 2 years from the date issued or until replaced by a dynamic or computer rating.



5. ## Registration and Fees:



All Local Combo Leagues (18 & Over, 40 & Over, 55 & Over and 65 & Over) must end team registration on or before July 7, 2017. Teams may continue to add players per local league regulations.



1. TennisLink is the official system for team registration.



2. Rosters must be entered in TennisLink before League play begins. Players may not move to a different team once match play has begun for that level, unless approved by the State Combo Doubles League Coordinator. Players may not be added to the team roster during local league flight playoffs or at any championship.



3. Deadline to register a team for Combo Doubles is July 7, 2017. Teams may not be added after deadline. The last day to add additional players to a roster is September 9, 2017. This is 3 days after online registering opens for teams advancing to State Championship.



4.. Fees will be collected (via credit card) when the captain/player registers on TennisLink. The cost to play in the GSTL Combo Doubles League is $20.00. This includes the $3.00 TennisLink user fee and the $6.00 SC League head tax.



5. Once a player is placed on a roster through TennisLink, the TennisLink fee and the SC Head Tax will not be refunded.



6. ## Local Play:



1. Each team will play a round robin competition with at least one other team in the same level. Each team in a round robin must play every other team in the round robin at least once and an equal number of times. Teams are expected to provide full line-ups for all team matches. Forfeits have become a real problem, and excessive forfeits will not be tolerated.



2. It may be necessary to divide a level into two or more sub-levels if there are too many teams for a single round robin group. In that case, there will be a

local league play-off to determine the GSTL champion and the team(s) to advance to the State Championships.



3. Each team must play at least three matches in local league to qualify for championship play.



5. Home team is responsible for providing courts, paying court fees (if applicable), and providing new balls.



6. Captains may not reschedule, without permission, any match except in the event of inclement weather (RAIN, SNOW, and HURRICANE and temperatures below 32 degrees or above 90 degrees in the summer, NOT Heat Index or Wind Chill). YOU MAY NOT RESCHEDULE JUST BECAUSE MANY OF YOUR TEAM ARE UNAVAILABLE due to any event, holiday or reason other than a Local tournament or State Championship, unless requested 2 weeks prior to match date, the opposing captain agrees, and you are granted permission by Combo LLC!!!!! Any courts played without meeting above criteria will be deemed forfeit. If you know of a major conflict that will make your team unable to field a court, contact the LLC immediately upon publication of the official schedule in Tennislink, and accommodation may be made. Such accommodations WILL NOT be made once the season is in progress. Any match rescheduled  under the above circumstances becomes an officially rescheduled match when approved by both captains and reported to Combo LLC, and any changes after that are not allowed. The match is now treated exactly the same as a regular scheduled match. If the player you planned on playing becomes unavailable, you must substitute a new player, and MAY NOT ask for another reschedule, except for weather. ALL RULES OF MATCH PLAY now apply to the new match time/date.



In the event of inclement weather, the captains should call the host club and ask about playability of courts, and only a captain may tell their players that a match has been cancelled. If the Visiting Captain cannot reach the Home Captain, the visiting captain should ALSO CALL THE HOST CLUB.



1. MATCHES and or COURTS RESCHEDULED DUE TO INCLEMENT WEATHER MUST BE COMPLETED WITHIN TWO WEEKS OF THE REGULARLY SCHEDULED MATCH.



2. If you wish to reschedule a match due to heat or cold rule, ALL COURTS MUST be rescheduled. If it is too hot for one court, it is too hot for all. If one  court cannot/will not play in the heat/cold and the other courts wish to play, that player may be substituted PRIOR to lineups being exchanged. If player cannot continue due to heat/cold AFTER lineups are exchanged, that player may forfeit, but cannot be replaced.



minute warm-up is appropriate after such a delay. If there is additional lightening, match may then be rescheduled for completion at another time.



3. If your match is rained out or incomplete due to weather, please contact the LLC IMMEDIATELY by email ( [ajordan4@sc.rr.com](mailto:ajordan4@sc.rr.com)) with the new match dates. Please copy the opposing captain on the email so we are all in agreement. Failure to inform LLC of rescheduling information will invoke the policy listed below (Local Play, 6, c.)



d.\*\**If the match or position has to be rescheduled or continued (if begun and rained out), due to the weather, and the captains/players involved are unable to agree on a makeup date or fail to contact the LLC with the information, the default match date will automatically be the Friday evening following the two week deadline for makeups, at 6:30pm, at the HOME team courts. Home captain is responsible for contacting their Club to reserve courts. If the home team courts are unavailable, the match will move to AWAY team courts. Any team unable to make that date and time will forfeit any un-played positions at that time. The only exception being if weather does not permit play at the new time, then the match is scheduled for the next soonest Friday after that.



7. In EXTREME CIRCUMSTANCES (local tournaments, state or sectional League Championships ONLY) both captains may request Combo League Coordinator approval to change a scheduled match or individual positions to an earlier date. This will be granted ONLY if the team requesting does not have enough players on scheduled match date to field all three positions. \*\*\*\*Not having your strong players available is not a LEGITIMATE reason to have a match rescheduled. Such requests must be submitted via email at least two weeks in advance and the rescheduled match must be made up prior to the regularly scheduled match.



If one or two POSITIONS (not entire match) need to be rescheduled, they must be played prior to the regularly scheduled match and captains must agree to this arrangement one week prior to the regularly scheduled match.



## Only positions with at least one player that is going to the championships or playing in the local tournament may play in any rescheduled match. Positions with players that will be out of town on match day for other reasons MAY NOT play early without a State/Tournament bound player with them in the position. If this rule is not followed, the team playing an unauthorized player will have the position defaulted.



Captains, please remember to try and cooperate with each other so players can support the local tournaments. WHAT GOES AROUND COMES AROUND!



## COORDINATORS MUST BE NOTIFIED OF ANY CHANGES

STATE, SECTIONAL AND NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIPS TAKE PRECEDENCE

OVER LOCAL LEAGUE MATCHES.



LLC may, at his/her discretion, extend the season end date in case of excessive inclement weather issues. Any extensions must be approved by State League Coordinator and must allow completion of matches in time for rosters and fees for teams advancing to state to arrive by the deadline date.



8. Captains should encourage all players to show up at least 15 minutes prior to the scheduled match time. Captains are encouraged to exchange lineups not later than 10 minutes prior to the scheduled match time UNLESS NOT ALL PLAYERS ARE PRESENT. The 15-minute default rule will apply – unless prior arrangements have been made between captains. Direct substitutions may be made for any player injured or becoming ill during warm-up. A direct substitution may also be made for a no-show. However, the no-show substitution must be made prior to expiration of the 15-minute default period. Captains and players are encouraged to begin the 10-minute warm up at least 10 minutes prior to the scheduled match time. If court(s) are not available at the scheduled time, each position will complete the 10-minute warm-up and commence the match as soon as a court(s) become available. Matches/Positions that do not start within 15 minutes of the scheduled start time or within 15 minutes of the time of court availability will be forfeited to the team whose player(s) is at the court ready to begin play. The home team captain and the visiting captain should confer to insure both agrees as to the “official” time for beginning the 15-minute default period. Any captain violating this policy will be reported to the Local League Coordinator and repeat offenders may have disciplinary sanction placed on the Captain and/or the team.



9. If a home team has access to more than one court surface, the home captain must call the opposing team to let them know at least 4 days before the scheduled match that they will be using multiple surfaces for their match. Within 2 days of this notice, the visiting team captain must notify the home team of the visitor’s choice of which positions will play on hard surfaces and clay surfaces.

## Surfaces may need to be changed without prior notice if courts are wet or the facility managers/pros say that the courts you were going to use for your matches are not playable at time of the match.



7. Scorecards and Lineups:



1. Line-up/scorecards will be used to exchange line-ups only. Each captain will provide their own line-up scorecard, or portion thereof. Each Captain should keep a copy of final scores to assist in posting or confirming scores on TennisLink. Suggestion: have the other captain check the scores on your

scorecard and sign it showing their agreement. This will avoid wrong scores and wrong names being put in Tennislink.



2. Captains must exchange line-ups simultaneously. NO CHANGES may be made after the line-up has been exchanged, except as allowed in the substitution rule below. NOTE that after lineups have been exchanged, if a team receives a forfeit, the receiving team DOES NOT HAVE THE OPTION TO CHANGE THEIR LINE-UP!



3. An individual match is started when the first ball is put in play.



8. ## Forfeits:



1. Forfeits are used for Defaults or for Disqualifications. These two different forms of forfeit are defined as follows:



1. Forfeit by DEFAULT- when a player fails to appear on time or after the start of an individual match, if injury to, illness of, or disqualification of a player occurs, the opponents will be awarded a default for that individual match only. The default principles shall be applicable, with the Sectional modifications that:



1. In the event of illness, injury, disqualification, or no-show of a player prior to the start of an individual match (once the lineup has been exchanged), a team may substitute a player in the affected position within the 15-minute default time, using a player not already listed on the lineup. If no such substitution can be made, the affected position will be forfeited in local leagues.



2. In the event that a team match must be re-scheduled and starting times are staggered, where opponents are not available and ready to play at the time agreed to by captains and reported to LLC, forfeits will be awarded in the affected position only.



2. Forfeit by DISQUALIFICATION- Disqualification occurs when a player is ineligible to participate for any reason \[i.e. under age, not a USTA member, NTRP disqualification, etc.]



3. SCORING OF FORFEITS: Scores for forfeits are not entered in TennisLink—the word Default is selected for “status” of match and the team receiving the default shall be awarded the win for the individual match that was forfeited. In the event of forfeit by both teams (double default), neither team will receive credit for the win.
4. Team Forfeits/Defaults: If a team forfeits an entire team match (2 positions).



1. If a team defaults an entire team match for any reason during round robin play (where you only play each team once), then all matches of that team played, or to be played, shall be null and void when determining standings, unless all teams in contention for the championships have already played the defaulting team in good faith, then those matches stand as played. In either case, defaulted matches received will be used for qualifying purposes for players advancing to Championship play.



2. If there is a full team default in a double or triple round robin (where you play each team more than once), only the RR tier/segments that have the full team default will be impacted. Each of the Round Robin segments will be treated as whole and separate within the local league flight. If the first RR was finished and the full team default occurred during the 2nd RR then all matches for the first RR would stand. Also remember that if all teams in contention had played the defaulting team, those matches would stay in the system.
3. The team that receives an entire team forfeit will not receive credit for the win. It is in the best interest of both teams to work it out so that at least 2 positions can be played. Captains, please remember to try and cooperate to play scheduled matches, even if you are in the right, and the other team is in the wrong. We all make mistakes, and we all want to play matches.



4. If it is determined by the Local League Coordinator, at any time during the season, that such a team default will affect the league standings in a material fashion ( i.e., which team goes to local league playoffs or State Championships) then none of the team’s individual matches for the entire season will count in the final standings. Per items a. and b. above.



5. Number of position defaults a team may have per season(s) is 20% of the number of positions scheduled. (Example: If your level is scheduled for seven matches during the season (21 positions), you may have only 4 positions defaulted during the season.)
6. ## A grievance may be filed against any team that defaults an excessive amount of individual matches or that defaults an entire team match.

The situation will be assessed by the Grievance Committee and penalties imposed as appropriate. Penalties could include barring the team and/or its players from participating in future Grand Strand Combo Tennis League play for some specific period.

ANY TEAM THAT DEFAULTS AN ENTIRE MATCH WILL BE SUBJECT TO A GRIEVANCE FILED, BY THE LOCAL LEAGUE COORDINATOR, AGAINST THE ENTIRE TEAM AND WILL RESULT IN THEIR SUSPENSION FROM LEAGUE FOR THE NEXT THREE MONTHS.

5. For a forfeit to count as a win, the player\[s] receiving the forfeit must be present at the match site. Players receiving the forfeit must be listed on the line-up and entered in TennisLink. Players giving the forfeit cannot be entered in TennisLink.



6. In case of a forfeit, the # 3 doubles positions must be forfeited first. Forfeits must always be from the bottom up. Please check your USTA regulations for further examples of how to forfeit.



7. In the event line-ups have already been exchanged and a player listed fails to show, that position in which the player was to play, is the position that is forfeited (defaulted). Once exchanged, line-ups may not be rearranged.



8. Two players will play together in the higher position when both of their partners do not show in order to avoid two defaults (as long as combined ratings do not exceed the designated level of play.)



9. Points awarded for forfeits during original line-up exchange will stand. No players involved in such forfeit can participate if the match is rescheduled due to weather after lineups are exchanged.



10. ## Do not put someone in the number one or two positions that you know is going to be late or you know will not show. Repeat offences will be grounds for a grievance to be filed against the captain by the local league coordinator.



9. Retirements:



A retirement occurs when an individual match has started and a player is unable to continue due to injury, loss of condition, or emergency.



SCORING OF RETIREMENTS: In case of retirement after commencement of match, the non-retiring player\[s] shall be credited with such number of additional games as would have been won if the match were completed and the non- retiring player\[s] won every subsequent game. Note: for NTRP computer data entry, actual scores are required, (i.e. the winner of the retirement if the match ended at 6-4, 4-3, should be recorded as a retirement at that score.)



10. ## Reporting scores



1. All scores MUST be recorded in TennisLink by the WINNING team captain, within 24 hours after the last position of each match is finished. The LOSING team captain MUST confirm the match score within 48 Hours after the final position scores are recorded. If the captain fails to confirm the scores, TennisLink will confirm them automatically. ONCE TENNISLINK HAS CONFIRMED THE SCORES, CHANGES MAY NOT BE MADE. The local league season ends on the date published in Tennislink as the league season end date. No matches may be played after the league season end date. Any matches/position not played by the league season end date will go in Tennislink as a double default.



2. If a captain disputes the scores in TennisLink, the captain must also notify the League Coordinator right away that there is a disputed score.



3. If scores are not entered into Tennislink in a timely manner, the computer assumes the match is unplayed and you WILL receive a call from the LLC to 

 explain the unfinished match. DON’T MAKE ME CALL YOU!!!!!



11. ## Court procedures:



1. Players are not allowed a rest period between the first and second game of each set. They must change sides and continue play. Players do not have the option of taking a ten-minute break between the second set and the

10-point Match Tiebreak used in lieu of the third set. A two-minute (or 120 second) break may be taken between the second set and the 10-point match tiebreak, the same as between the first and second sets.



2. Spectators may not aid players in making a line call or in determining the score. Spectators may not participate in the match in any fashion, and must refrain from doing so even if asked by the player \[s]. Coaching of any player at any time is prohibited.



3. Spectators may QUIETLY watch a match in progress. They should not sit or stand at the end of the court immediately behind the servers or receivers or at the side fence because it is a distraction to the players. It is the responsibility of each team to control the noise and behavior of its spectators; if not controlled, a protest may be filed against the offending team.



4. No line judge or umpire will be provided for matches. Players are urged to

call the score after each point to avoid confusion. Total disagreement concerning the score in the game will result in a spin of the racquet if players are unable to go back to a score they both agree on. If a conflict occurs during match play over line calls, the players involved may request that the captain of each team appoint a lines person for the remainder of match.



5. FOOT FAULTS are illegal. Constant and blatant foot-faulting gives the server a definite advantage, and should be politely brought to the attention of the server during the match. If it continues, the players involved may request that captains of both teams appoint a line person for the remainder of that match.



6. Bathroom breaks may be taken at any time. It is preferred that they be taken at set breaks or at a changeover. The person taking the bathroom break may not talk to anyone or a Grievance may be filed.



7. Disputes on court:



1. In GSTL matches where there is no umpire, players themselves act as umpires and must see that obvious violations of the rules do not occur. It is imperative that players know the USTA, STA, South Carolina AND GSTL regulations which govern play.



2. Coaches or club pros must refrain from intrusion in discussions between players or captains. It is the responsibility of the two captains, not the pro/coach, to decide on the resolution of the Incident.



3. Disputes should be settled between players before the match is finished. Remember, all points played in good faith stand. It is hoped that the players involved can resolve the dispute themselves. If that is not possible, the procedure to follow is:



1. A player should inform the opponent of the problem and his/her intent to leave the court to obtain the assistance of his/her captain. The player should leave their racquet on the court when going for the captain. The captain should contact the opponent’s captain and they should try to resolve the dispute. If the captains are involved in playing a match, the players may have to postpone their play until the captains are available to assist them. (This is a good reason to have a non-playing teammate act as co-captain).



2. If the captains and players cannot agree on a resolution to the conflict, the offended player\[s] may:



1. Notify the opponent that due to his/her opinion that a violation of the rules occurred, he/she is going to continue to play but that he/she is playing under protest and intends to file a grievance with GSTL after

the match is completed. His/her captain would then record the protest on the line-up exchange and have the opposing captain initial.



2. Stop play—telling his/her opponent why, and have her captain indicate on the scorecard that the match was stopped in protest. The exact place and score of the match when play stopped must be recorded and signed by both captains.



The captain or designated captain at the match has 24 hours in which to register a complaint with the Local League Coordinator. This initial report may be done by phone but must be followed up within one week with a written grievance. Failure to comply with the 24-hour rule renders the grievance invalid. If the team captain chooses to file a formal grievance, the captain must submit the grievance to the Local League Coordinator on the USTA SC grievance form (available on [This USTA Southern Page](http://www.southern.usta.com/USA-League-Tennis-Pages/9304_USTA_Southern_Section_Fair_Play_Grievance_Protocol_2009/) ) and to the captain of the opposing team.



<http://www.southern.usta.com/USA-League-Tennis-Pages/9304_UST> A_Southern_Section_Fair_Play_Grievance_Protocol_2009/



## The Local League Coordinator will then forward the Grievance to the GSTL Grievance Committee for action.



12. Progression to state championships:



1. Local League winners will be determined based on team Matches Won or winning percentage of team matches. In the event of a tie, whether in round robin or single elimination, the state recommends that the tie shall be broken by the first of the following procedures that does so



1. Individual Positions. Winner of the most individual matches in the entire competition.



2. Head-to head. Winner of head-to-head match.



3. Sets. Loser of fewest number of sets.



4. Games. Loser of the fewest number of games.



5. A method to be determined by the Local League Coordinator.

For GSTL, a. Fewest Number of positions forfeited in season

b. Coin Flip



2. ## Each Local League MUST complete their Local League Season prior to the South Carolina Combo Doubles State League Championships and

submit the required information to the Combo Doubles State League Coordinator by September 27, 2017



3. When a Local League does not have the required number of Teams, (two teams), in either the 18 & Over Age Group, 40 & Over Age Group, 55 & Over Age Group, and 65 & Over Age Group to constitute a level, the affected Local League Coordinators, shall either:



1. Offer to move that team to another age division offered in that area in that particular level, if applicable.



2. Move individual players to another team in that area, if applicable, or move them to an “Extra Players” flight to hold for future play in other leagues.



3. The Director of Leagues or State League Coordinator may move a singleton team to another area’s league tree only if it is agreed upon by both local league coordinators and accomplished before that recipient area’s deadline. Complete teams that are moved to play in a local league area other than their home local league must secure home courts in that local league they choose to participate unless both local league coordinators agree on something different.



4. Refund all or a portion of the registration fee in accordance with the Local League policy.



Teams playing in a Local League Area other than the area that has been the designated area for their Local League must secure home courts in the Local League Area where they plan to participate and pay all applicable court fees



4. A player must play at least one match locally or receive one default locally to advance to the state championships. A default RECEIVED will qualify for advancement to the championships; A default GIVEN will not qualify. A default will count as a qualifying match for State Championship and Sectional Championships.



5. Players who qualify for South Carolina Combo Doubles State League Championships may advance on more than one team within an age group as long as they are at different NTRP levels. NO Scheduling accommodations will be made, however, for players on multiple teams.



6. Deposit Fee: A $250.00 Deposit from each team advancing to the championships is Required. The deposit is to be sent to the Local League Coordinator. Any team withdrawing from a championship after the deadline for online registration will be subject to a fine of $250 per team, payable to USTA SC. Once championship play has begun, the Local League Coordinator will destroy the check. A grievance may be filed against the withdrawing team in addition to the

$250 fine. Penalties against these team members may include that all members on the submitted roster be banned from participating in any USTA leagues for a period of up to 364 days.



7. Championship fees must be submitted by the Championship deadline date along with the rosters for each team participating at the championships.



Teams that withdraw from the championship after the online registration deadline date and before the draws are published will lose their $250 deposit but may request a refund for registration fees. Teams that withdraw from the  championship after the draws have been published will lose their $250 deposit and their registration fees.



A team substituted for the withdrawing team will not be responsible for championship fees other than for those players exceeding the number of players paid for by the withdrawing team. If fees were not paid by the withdrawing team, that team’s Local League will pay fees. Recovery of championship fees will be up to the appropriate Local Leagues. Grand Strand Tennis League will collect the state registration fees paid by the league before anyone on the withdrawing team can play another season in the Grand Strand.



8. A fee of $20 per player attending States is paid by GSTL to the State. GSTL uses registration fees to reimburse for up to 8 combo team members to attend States. Each team must pay $20 per player after the first 8 players, and pay online that amount at the time of online registration in order to secure their spot at States.



9. Teams that withdraw from the USTA SC Championships after the entry fees have been paid by GSTL will be required to reimburse the GSTL if a replacement GSTL team cannot be found. If GSTL has to forfeit entry fees for the withdrawing team, members of the withdrawing team will not be eligible to participate in future league play until the reimbursement to GSTL has been received.



10. ANY TEAM DEFAULTING A COURT FOR ANY REASON AT THE STATE CHAMPIONSHIPS WILL INCUR A $100 FINE (per court) PAYABLE IMMEDIATELY (CASH OR CHECK) FOR EACH COURT DEFAULTED. If the team does not pay the fine, a grievance may be filed against all players on the State roster, which could result in the suspension of play from any USTA League play until the fine is paid. Additionally, you will not be allowed to take the court for any following matches until the fine for the defaulted match is paid. It is your responsibility to have players on every court at each match at State Championships. Please make note of this when deciding how many players to have on your team, as many players may not be willing or able to go to State.
11. If an entire team defaults an entire match during a championship, a grievance will be filed against all members on the team roster that is submitted for the championship.
